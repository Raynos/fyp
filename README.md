My final year project, google reader meta data visualization

## Todo

 - on hover hand for clicking titles (done)
 - blog content that's expanded should be visually different (done)
    - with a dark border
    - and a light background
    - and dark text
 - new tab 4 linkz (done)
 - bugs with related clicks not opening articles 
 - padding to divs so links to touch right edge (done?)
 - title should not be link, is confusing (done)


 just so you can say Informal feedback from n users came up with the following suggestions for refinements to the user interface. Most deal with adding clarity to the visual outline of the content, improving the user experience. 

// list/comment the points

After improving the interface with these suggestions, a formal survey was carried out with m users providing feedback via an online survey.

// survey design, justify questions, discuss results and how they support the notion that the application meets the initial criteria you set out with
